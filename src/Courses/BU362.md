# Gordon Power Case

## Problem Statement

Gordon Power Tools is faced with the decision of whether they should pursue the advertising campaign in order to help their business overall by increasing sales, profits and their brand image.


## Alternatives

* Decide to pursue the advertising campaign - spend $45,000 to work with the advertising agency Summit in order to promote their products.
* Gordon Power Tools could not pursue anything and continue with their current business operations.
* Collaborate with Excelsior to market their products in line with their products.
* Hire an additional salesperson – Currently, the executives don’t have the time to call on all the accounts which is crucial in the decision making process. Salespeople would help to alleviate this issue.

## Decision Criteria

* Profits in short-term
* Porifts in long-term
* Relationship with Excelsior
* Brand Awareness (Gordon's brand)

## Financial Analysis

Since the proposed advertising campaign will cost $43,200, we need to sell at least 411 amount of units as a result of this campaign in order to break even. So we require the campaign to stimulate sales by at least this much.

Calculations:

$43200/(105)= 412 chainsaws

We currently have 15% of the market and in order to close the advertising campaign costs, we only need to add 1.6% more.

## Alternatives

1. Implement advertising campaign focusing on Excelsior

 - Keep the current brand recognition from Excelsior and thus it's less costly to advertise since its better known than Gordon.

- Increases vulnerability of Gordon because he becomes dependent on the Excelsior brand name

2. Accept the agency's advertising proposal

- We have our own brand and thus have more control over how we operate and market

- More exposure for Gordon's power tools

- We saw that most customers were familiar with the product before they bought it and also had a brand in bind before buying; if we can create a good image for Gordon, we can capitalize on this.

**Recommendation**: Accept the agency's proposal. With a good advertising campaign, we have huge potential to create brand recognition which, based on the survey, is a good predictor of sales.

# JM's Signature Restaurant

## Problem Statement

Joshua Matthew needs to decide whether or not to open up a restaurant in the already saturated theatre district of Toronto or pass up the opportunity and continue to operate his previous two restaurants. If he decides to go ahead, what are the marketing plans that are needed to meet his target revenues of $4 million and maintain his current reputation?

## Objectives

* $4 million revenue goal
* Have a positive impact on reputation

## SWOT Analysis

### Opportunities: 

* There is a great lease currently available for the restaurant in the theatre district.
    * High traffic area: 1 million residents in the city, 5.2 million residents within an hour’s commute, & 22 million tourists annually

### Threats 

* 71 other restaurants in area with similar price range, 12 of which have similar atmosphere.
* Meals are always an afterthought in the area

### Strengths

* Previous successful experience in restaurant business with two other restaurants in city
    * existing loyal customer base
    * skilled chef lined up with plan to make special signature dish every two weeks to demonstrate quality of dining experience & provide reason to come back

### Weaknesses
* overly optimistic about the success of his previous restaurants
  * relies on free advertising
  * relies on high seat turnover with expectation that this is a spot where “love affairs, business deals, and friendships begin” which would involve customers spending more time


## Competitive Analysis

![](screenshots/JMRestaurantChart.png)

## Alternatives

1. Cookbook: Joshua could choose to make a cookbook consisting of his different recipes instead of emailing them to customers and sell it for a profit in addition to the restaurant. Instead of giving away recipes to clients to remind them of the experience they had, these recipes could be combined into a cookbook and sold to customers as a way to make additional revenues. The cookbook, will potentially increase or maintain Joshua’s current positive reputation.
2. Increase seats: Up the seating to 150, which is slightly over the average of restaurants, but more seats than what he has now. By increasing the number of seats to 150, the restaurant will be capable of servicing 340 customers per day (including the bar), compared to the 232 in the previous plan. This will increase potential revenues and customer satisfaction as customers will be more satisfied because they won’t have to wait as long to be serviced.
3. Catering to corporate lunches, corporate events, conferences, etc.: Instead of opening up an additional restaurant, the company should focus on catering to different events in the Greater Toronto Area because of its close proximity to the financial and entertainment district. Since catering is generally an expensive endeavor, it is a potential source of revenues.   

## Target Market

* Culture Carl

* Corporate Cathy and Cultured Carl

* Corporate Cathy

## Evaluate each alternative

### Cookbook

Assume the cook book price is $30.

Assume COGS = $4.50

Additional Costs (graphic designer, editor, chef) = $5,000

Assume 10% of customers buy a cookbook

262 customers per day @ 350 days = 91,700 customers

Assume 15% are repeat, so 85% are new = 77,945

Assume 10% buy the book = 7,795

Revenue  = 7,795 * 30 = 233,850

COGS = 7,795*$ 4.50 = $35,077.50

GP = 198,772.5

NP excluding Tax = 193,772.50

Since this alternative will not help us reach our $4 million goal (still about 1M) below, it will provide a good reputation for the company and extra publicity.

### Increase the number of seats

![](screenshots/JMRestaurantincome.png)

## Recommendation

Increase the seating of the restaurant. This will give Joshua the opportunity to open a restaurant in the theatre district. Also, it will attain his $4 million dollar revenue goal. Guests will still have more space than other restaurants, but it is slightly less than what was planned before. This will not be negative to his reputation.

# Fantastik All-Purpose Cleaner

## Problem Statement

The fantastik brand is currently experiencing a steady decline of market share in the highly competitive all-purpose cleaning market. This is due to a shift in consumer demand towards premium cleaning products, private label brands, products that are less expensive and range in variety. James Dunbar, the brand manager at SC Johnson, needs a long-term brand strategy for the fantastik brand that will meet his current objectives.

## Objectives

* The alternative should comply with SC Johnson’s current environmental policies
* The current market leadership position that fantastik holds should be maintained in the short term, and increased in the long term.

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths

* Strong brand loyalty
* Good relationship with many chain retailers
* Existing market leadership
* Conscious about environmental impacts of products
* Strong care about families health

### Weaknesses
* No change to the product in years, and consumers are looking for i
* Small advertising budget a SC Johnson has cut a majority of the marketing associated with the fantastik brand
* Little room for differentiation given SC Johnson’s strict environmental policies.

### Opportunities

* Environmentally-friendly social trend
* Demand for new innovative scents
* More product is being sold on promotion
* Customers respond primarily to price incentives

### Threats

* Easy for companies to copy new scents, when spending lots of * money to develop them
* Private label brands are becoming increasingly popular and can dominate the retail market
* Consumers are shifting towards higher priced premium cleaners
* Competitive to get shelf space

### Target Market

The target market for Fantastik tends to have children between 6 - 17 living at home, drives a station wagon, use coupons, has a swimming pool, owns a vacation home and listens to classical and “oldies” music radio stations. They often watch the Learning Channel, TSN, Comedy Network and the Weather Network on TV. They read enRoute, Fashion Magazine, National Post Business, TV Guide and Time.

### Positioning Map

We have chosen to position the competition based on price and variety in scents as we feel that these are two important factors that are looked at by the customer when making a purchase.

![](screenshots/fantastikMap1.png)
![](screenshots/fantastikMap2.png)

## Alternatives

1. Market to college students to gain brand awareness
    * Target market = Poor College Student Carrie
      * Getting to the students early before other brands
      * First time being on their own, having to buy cleaning products

        By providing a sample package of SC Johnson products, it gives students a starting point for cleaning products. When they go to the store to purchase more supplies, they are going to choose products that they have already used in the past, creating brand awareness and brand loyalty not only for the fantastik brand but for SC Johnson products in general.

2. Have a part of the profit go to an environmental incentive

Target market = Environmentally Conscious Eric

        By giving a portion of profits to an environmentally focused organization, environmentally conscious consumers consumers are made aware of SC Johnson’s values towards the environment and are more likely to make a purchase as a result.

3. Have reusable bottles - aka have multiple locations where you can refill your bottle for a portion of the price  

    Target market = Environmentally Conscious Eric

        By giving consumers the opportunity to reuse their bottle instead of buying a new one, we are rewarding environmentally friendly behaviour

        Aligning our company strategy with the current social trends and wants of our target market

Financials

Alternative 2:

    Assume 5 cents of each bottle purchased goes to supporting the reductions of removing plastic from the ocean. Assume sales increase by 5%.

Contribution Margin New  =$1.20 - $0.05 = $1.15

Sales Old = 37.9% * 32,000,000 / 3.69 = 12,128,000 /3.69 = 3,286,721 units

New Gross Profit = 3,286,721* 1.15 * 1.05 = $4,346,689

Old Gross Profit = 3,286,721 * 1.2 = $3,944,065.2

Increase in Gross Profit =  4,346,689 - 3,944,065.20 = 402,623

Total Donation after 1 Year = 3,451,057.05 * 0.05= $172,553




## Recommendation

Given our three alternatives, we recommend that James chooses to go with alternative 2. By providing a donation to an organization that is focused on removing plastic from the ocean with every bottle of fantastik that is sold, the number of units sold will increase due to the incentives that are created. In the end, the dollar sales under the fantastk brand will increase and the company will stay true to its environmental values.

# Camar Automotive Hoist

## Ebrahims Problem Statement

Camar Automotive Heist has experienced a rapid growth in th last 3 years. Mark Camar, the president of CAH, needs to implement a srategy that keeps his company on a fast growth track Mark needs to determine the best strategies to expand in the US or enter into the European market to achieve his objectives.

1. Give background
2. Talk about underlying issue
3. Mention some of the recommendations

## Problem Statement

Underlying issue: Want to keep rapid growth

Background: In 1999, companies were used to specializing in one European country whereas the EU was a heterogenous region. The United States on the other hand is already a very diverse region and so USA companies are used to dealing with hetereogenous regions.

Problem Statement: CAH are experiencing rapid growth and want to continue to do so and are considering EU entry, NA expansion.

## Objectives

* Reputation and quality is important to him.
* Growth
  * Quantifying growth: See how fast market share increases in previous years and see what we need to maintain it
* Mitigate Risk

## SWOT Analysis

Ebrahim likes a small paragraph after the SWOT analysis Undergrad that gives the implications of the points.

### Strengths

* Safety features
* Strong reputation
* High quality products
* Easy to install
* Patents
* Strong salesforce
* Specialized for wheel alignments

### Weaknesses

* Weak bargaining power in the United States
* More expensive

### Opportunities

* European Union entry
* United States expansion
* Customer lack of awareness

### Threats

* German company makes scissor lift
* Fluctuating exchange rate
* Approval process for international sales
* Tariffs

## Customer Analysis: Segmentation

Ebrahim wants the segments to be very hetereogenous.

| | Specialty Shops  | Large Mechanic Chains  | New Car Dealerships  |   |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Who?  | Specialize in wheel alignment (chains, garages)  | Canadian Tire, Goodyear, etc.  | High-end dealerships that sell new cars  |   |
| What? | Unique turn plates allow for accurate and easy performance of wheel alignment  | Specific hoist meant soley for wheel alignment  | Best quality hoists for the best quality service  |   |
| Where?| North America  | Nation-wide  |  Few in every city |   |
| Why?  | Easy to install and operate  | High safety and reliability; low maintenance  | Want the customer to have the best experience  |   |
| How?  | Personal selling; word of mouth  | Personal selling; trade shows  | Approval through personal selling  |   |
| Size  |   |   |   |   |

## Competitive Analysis

|        | CAH                                   | AHV Lift                          | Mete Lift                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Safety        | High safety with emphasis on features | Standard                          | Low                            |
| Type of hoist | Scissor-lift                          | Scissor-lift, In-ground, two-post | Similar to CAH                 |
| Price         | Highly priced                         | Cheap                             | Slightly cheaper than CAH      |
| Quality       | High quality manufacturing            | Standard quality                  | High quality manufacturing     |
| Distribution  | Direct in Canada, wholesaler in USA   | Direct salesforce everywhere      | Regional in California, Oregon |
| | | |

## Quantifying

We look at number of lifts sold per population. We can compare Canada vs USA numbers and make the assumption that we can make one similar to the other.

## Decision Matrix

1. Identify criteria
2. Weight each criteria
3. Score each alternative

|Criteria|Weight|A1|A2
|----|----|---|---|
A|5|1|2
B|4|2|2
Total||13|18

Therefore, based on this decision matrix, we can say that A2 is the best weighted option.

We should also consider minimum requirements for a criterion.

Also, an objective can be a decision criterion. If it's not measurable, we can break down the objective into specific criteria.

We can have multiple different measures; risk, profitablity. We also need to know use calculations to support these rankings.

## Recommendation(s)

### Expand business in USA with New York Office

**Recommendation**: Expand business in the USA by directly selling the product rather than through the distributor. We will open an office in New York to service six New England states with a salesforce that is experienced in industry knowledge.

**Decision Criteria**

* Reputation and quality will be maintained as they will service and manufcature their own equipment
* Unrealized potential from wholesaler's lack of push strategy for the hoist can be realized by setting up shop in New York to service a larger market
* Close to the states geographically so does not require direct investment in manufacturing facility and thus mitigating major financial risk

**SWOT**

* Capitalize on every strength as CAH maintains or increases control over operations in the USA
* Exchange rate beneficial for US consumers mitigating expensive weakness
* Lack of wholesaler influence means higher bargaining power and more control over distribution

**Target Market**

Specialty shops for wheel alignment because of personal selling and less overhead for approval process as well as capitalizing on the unique wheel alignment features.

### Direct investment in Europe

**Alternative – Direct Investment in Europe **

Direct investment, where CAH would establish a manufacturing facility and set up a management group to market the lift in Germany.

**Pros**: 

*  Full control over the company 
    * Firm’s reputation of designing and manufacturing a quality product will be maintained 
* Less trade barriers – free movement 
* Germany favoured for both market potential and investment site opportunities 
* Less competition in Europe 
  
**Cons**: 
* Pierre might not be familiar with the European local market – might prove difficult in the marketing of the product 
* High risk due to high initial costs
* Exchange rates may fluctuate
  
**Costs** (**estimates within 20% of actual costs):
* $250,000 for capital equipment 
* $200,000 in incremental costs to set * the plant up
* $1,000,000 in inventory and accounts * receivable 
* $80,000 annual building rent 

## Decision Matrix

# Portable Heat Pad

## Problem Statement

Mark Tanner invested $250,000 in the purchase of the Canadian manufacturing and distribution rights to the Portable Heat Pad, a convenient and safe vinyl bag that provides a specific level of heat for its user, as well as a patent on the product that will last 17 years. The product is very versatile and can be used in a variety of ways, but after careful analysis Tanner decided that the medical segment had the most potential. Tanner needs to decide how to market the product between the institutional and/or home market to best suit the needs of profitable customers.

## Segmentation Chart

| Name | Athletic Aaron  | Nurse Nancy  |
|-------|---|---|
| Who?  | He goes for runs every morning and experiences a bad case of runners knees. He doesn’t believe in taking over the counter prescription medication and looks for natural methods of chronic pain management so he can continue his daily runs  | Works in the medical field in an area such as a hospital, chiropractic clinic, or nursing home. She cares about her patients and wants the best for them. She is often faced with the task of having to help her patients find creative ways to chronic pain management  |
| What? | Relieve pain  | Relieve patient pain | 
| Where?| Home use  | Nursing homes and hospitals  |
| Why?  | To relieve minor sports injuries  | To relieve arthiritc injuries  | 

## Positioning Map

![](screenshots/heatPadMap1.png)
![](screenshots/heatPadMap2.png)

## Recommendation

The Portable Heat Pad should be marketed to the end consumer through doctors and other medical personnel. Doctors have the ability to influence the purchasing decisions of their patients by making recommendations regarding what products should and should not be purchased to address different medical conditions. By advertising the Portable Heat Pad through doctors and medical personnel, the company is able to increase purchase in the at-home market.

# Old El Paso

## Problem Statement

Facing difficulty in growing the Old El Paso brand amidst low category growth rates and market saturation, Kurt Olson, Associate Marketing Manager, needs to implement a strategy that results in immediate sales growth and, in the long-term, increased customer awareness as well as a change in customer perception of Mexican meal preparation.

## Objectives

* Maintain profitability
* Grow sales by 5%
* Increase top of mind customer awareness
* Create perception that Mexican meals are **not** inconvenient and difficult to prepare

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths

* Market leader in Mexican food and component category
* Strong brand recognition
  
### Weaknesses

* Small presence in salsa market
* Predominantly planned purchaase
* High price
* Often placed in ethnic food aisle

### Opportunities

*  Mexican sauce market 
*  Mass merchandisers and club channels

### Threats

* Private label brands
* Customers prepare tacos only 3 times a year

## Alternatives

### 1. Turn Old El Paso into a suite of Mexican products

This is my crazy idea.

Instead of Old El Paso being synonymous with meal kits, components, and salsa, we use the strong brand equity of El Paso and push development of more mexican products outside of this product category.

A quick google search shows these are the most popular Mexican foods:

1. Burrito
2. Enchilada
3. Carne Asada
4. Quesadilla

If we create meal kits for each of these under the Old El Paso brand, we create product breadth as well as create a whole suite of trusted products from the Old El Paso brand. Whereas gorcery stores were previously putting us in the thnic aisle, they will now consider placing all our products in one area on the shelf in the correct aisle (similar to how Kraft products are always together).

### 2. Aggressively push mass merchandisers and club channels

Added focus on mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart and Zellers and club channels like Costco. 

As a premium product, we can sell to club channels who are able to sell the products for cheaper prices than grocery stores. We're also don't have to worr about shelf space as much here.

In terms of mass merchandisers, Old El Paso will have a similar strategy as other grocery stores but with the added benefit of tapping into Wal-Mart's high traffic.

### 3. Focus on the sauce market

The Mexican sauce market is extremely untapped and with enough aggressive marketing, Old El Paso's brand equity can be leveraged to increase market share here and drive sales.

## Evaluation of Alternatives

### Alternative 2

We will assume that the 20% of customers that go to mass merchandisers and club channels is currenty untapped. 

We will similarly assume that, at most, we can get the same market share in this 20% of the market; that is, we have a 91.2 percent market share in kits, 70.4 market share in components, and 15.6% market share in salsa. At worst, we will assume all three products will hav similar penetration rates and thus grow at the most pessimistic rate of 15.6%.

The total dollar volume of kits, components, and salsa is 34,270,710, 61,194,807,and 111,045,385 respectively. 

So we have that $20\% \cdot (91.2\%\cdot34,270,710 + 70.4\%\cdot61,194,807 + 15.6\%\cdot111,045,385) = 18,331,822.3416$ in additional revenue at best.

At worst, we have that $20\% \cdot 15.6\% \cdot (34,270,710 + 61,194,807 + 111,045,385)=6,443,140.1424$ in additional revenue.

We will assume that COGS includes promotion costs and thus the contribution margin is unaffected. 

In total this grows sales by either 20% at best or by 7.03% at worst.
