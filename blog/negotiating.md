I just wanted to start off and make it clear that there is nothing ground-breaking in this blog post; I didn't do anything new or special to negotiate -- this is just to share my personal experience negotiating the offers that I had and attempting to make the best of them!

### tl;dr:

I had the following offers in hand:

* Robinhood (Menlo Park) at around 230k
* Microsoft (Redmond) at around 184k
* Google (Chicago) at around 155k
* Confluent (Remote) at around 185k -- I got this offer right at the tail end of my negotiations

I used those offers to negotiate as follows:

1. I used Robinhood (~230k) to negotiate Google from ~155k to ~184k
1. I used Robinhood (~230k) and Google (~184k) to negotiate Microsoft from ~184k to ~220k
1. I used Microsoft (~220k) to negotiate Google from ~184k to ~199k
1. I used Confluent (~204k) to negotiate Google from ~199k to ~212k
1. I accepted Google!

### Personal Circumstances

Going into this search, I was almost entirely set on finding a job in Chicago or an opportunity that would allow me to stay in Chicago (through remote work). This was *the* driving factor in making my decision. For that reason, I was mostly set on either Google or Confluent; however, I needed to use the other offers to maximize the value of the offer I was hoping to accept.

### The initial offers on hand

#### Robinhood

Based out of Menlo Park, I was really sold on the company and the work they were doing (despite some image-ruining scandals in 2020). The interview process was long but *very* fast and the questions asked were pretty fair. Their offer was **non-negotiable**:

Base Salary: $135,000\
Equity: $175,000 vesting equally over 4 years\
Yearly Target Bonus: $13,500 (10% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $30,000\
Relocation Bonus: $5,500 (after-tax)

**Total Compensation Year 1: $227,750**

#### Microsoft

This offer was for the commerce+ecosystems business group and was based in Redmond, Washington. The interview process was a phone screen and 4 round final; all five of these had a strong behavioural component and around 20 minutes of solving straightforward leetcode easy level questions:

Base Salary: $112,500\
Equity: $120,000 vesting equally over 4 years\
Yearly Target Bonus: $11,250 (10% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $25,000\
Relocation Bonus: $5,500

**Total Compensation Year 1: $184,250**

#### Google

I interned at Google for a team in Sunnyvale, but for my conversion to full-time, I requested the Chicago office. This was the base Chicago offer:

Base Salary: $111,000\
Equity: $85,000 with 33% year 1, 33% year 2, 22% year 3, and 12% year 4.\
Yearly Target Bonus: $16,650 (15% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $0\
Relocation Bonus: $0

#### Confluent

With about a week left to accept Google, I started the interview process at Confluent, which meant I had to get my Google deadline extended by 1 week. This is the initial offer from Confluent for remote in Chicago (note that this was non-negotiable):

Base Salary: $121,500\
Equity: $130,000
Yearly Target Bonus: $6,075 (5% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $25,000\
Relocation Bonus: $0

**Total Compensation Year 1: $185,075**


### Location Adjustments

#### Google
The cost of living in Chicago is remarkably cheaper than in Seattle or the Bay Area. Google, however, does not consider the cost of *living* when negotiating offers; rather, the compensation team considers the cost of *labour*. Take that as you will, but it translated as follows:

1. Chicago is 15% cheaper than HCOL areas (Bay Area, NYC, etc.).
2. Chicago is 5% cheaper than MCOL areas (Seattle, Boston, etc.)

Therefore, when sending Google offers from other locations, they would discount those offers by 15% or 5% accordingly and *then* match them.

#### Confluent

On the other hand, Confluent splits up the USA into prime areas and non-prime, with a flat salary across prime areas (such as Seattle, Bay Area, NYC) and a lower flat salary across everywhere else (like Chicago).

In particular, the prime offer from Confluent was 10% higher. **You might have noticed this leaves 5% of arbitrage between Confluent and Google if I requested an offer for the location of, say, Seattle...**

### Round 1: Send Robinhood to Google

First, I sent my Robinhood offer to my recruiter at Google and asked her to forward it to the compensation team. They discounted the Robinhood offer by 15% (to account for location), and then matched it:

<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;">
I want to let you know that I've negotiated with compensation using your RobinHood offer (since that is higher). The compensation team says "We’re matching the competing offer in region (Bay Area), and transferring over to the permanent location (Chicago) to take into consideration the Cost of Labor difference, and therefore under competing offer by 15% in Y1/2."

Base: $111,000 \
Bonus: 15.00% \
Equity: $119,000 \
Sign-on: $17,000 \
Total Comp Year 1: **$183,920**
</blockquote>

I was more than happy with this offer; when you take into account the cost of living in Chicago, this salary had far more buying power than the equivalent Bay Area or Seattle salaries:

### Round 2: Send Robinhood and Google to Microsoft

I was pretty happy with the Google offer as it was, but I wanted to see if I could increase Microsoft to a point where the 5% location discount would still be higher than the updated Chicago Salary.

To do this, I had to get an L60 offer (as opposed to the default L59 offer, check out levels.fyi if you don't recognize these terms). I explicitly asked my recruiter if this was possible and she let me know that I'll have to write an email that she'll be sending to the compensation team to make my case. This is what I wrote in the email:

<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;">
I’m writing this email to make my case for an increase in compensation and/or starting level as a new grad at Microsoft.
 
In terms of experience, I’ve done 7 internships during my undergrad:

- DevOps Engineer at Camis Inc. from May 2017 to August 2017
- Software Developer at Bank of Montreal from January 2018 to April 2018
- Mobile Developer at National Logistics Services from September 2018 to December 2018
- Data Science Intern at Vida Health from May 2019 to August 2019
- Software Engineer (Infrastructure) at Yelp from January 2020 to April 2020
- Software Development Engineer at Amazon (AWS) from September 2020 to December 2020
- Software Engineer at Google (Google Cloud) from May 2021 to August 2021
 
These internships have given me a breadth of experience in a variety of aspects of software development ranging from DevOps to Infrastructure to Cloud to Data Science that I feel makes me a strong candidate at Microsoft.
 
On top of this, I have several open source projects that are used by thousands of users:
- Jupyterlab-Sparkmonitor (https://github.com/itsjafer/jupyterlab-spark monitor) is a jupyterlab extension with over 5000 installs 
- Lever Resume Parser (https://github.com/itsjafer/resume-parser) has been used by over 20,000 unique users
- Schwab API is a python library I created to interact with Charles Schwab (https://github.com/itsjafer/schwab-api)
 
Finally, I currently have competing offers from Robinhood and Google. The details of those offers are attached in this email but can be summarized as:
 
Robinhood (Menlo Park): 230k first year TC\
Google (Chicago): 184k first year TC
</blockquote>

The result was an updated Microsoft Offer at L60:

Base Salary: $121,000\
Equity: $130,000 vesting equally over 4 years\
Yearly Target Bonus: $12,100 (10% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $50,000\
Relocation Bonus: $5,500

**Total Compensation Year 1: $221,100**

Again, this was a fantastic offer and I was pleasantly surprised at how high these numbers were.

### Round 3: Send Google the updated Microsoft Offer

I wasn't sure if the increased Microsoft offer would result in any action from Google's compensation team, considering that the salary was, in absolute values, less than Robinhood. However, I didn't think there was any harm in sending the offer anyway.

Soon after, my recruiter told me that they compensation team *were* able to increase the offer:

<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;">

*Microsoft*

Please keep in mind that we’re taking into consideration the Cost of Labor difference between the two regions (Redmond vs Chicago), and therefore under the competing offer by 5% in Y1-Y2.

*RobinHood*

Our offer is now coming in at 87% of the RobinHood offer but taking into consideration the 15% cost of labor difference between Bay Area and Chicago our compensation team considers our offer 2% above RobinHood after 2 years. 
</blockquote>

The updated offer came out to:

Base Salary: $111,000\
Equity: $130,000 (33%/33%/22%/12%)\
Yearly Target Bonus: $16,650 (15% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $20,000\
Relocation Bonus: $8,400

**Total Compensation Year 1: $198,950**

Note that I was able to get the relocation bonus by choosing to relocate from my home near my University (in Waterloo, Ontario).

This was a fantastic offer, when taking into account cost of living, and the offers that I had in hand!

### Round 4: Send Google the offer from Confluent

At this point, I had successfully passed the Confluent interviews and received an offer for Chicago. The terms of the offer were quite similar to Google's, but I thought it'd be worth sending it to them anyway. Unfortunately, this time I was not as fortunate and my recruiter was not able to increase the Google offer:

<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;">
Looking at the Confluent and Google offer side by side it seems that the Google offer is coming in at 104% of the Confluent offer over 2 years. It's hard to model accurately after 2 years because of the variability regarding your bonus and equity refresh grants (based on your performance). Because the Google offer is higher over 2 years the compensation team won't be able to increase.
</blockquote>

*However*, all was not lost. I was curious about Confluent's offer if I were to relocate to, say, *Seattle* and my Confluent recruiter was able to come back with the following numbers:

Base Salary: $135,000\
Equity: $150,000
Yearly Target Bonus: $6,750 (5% of base)\
Signing Bonus: $25,000\
Relocation Bonus: $0

**Total Compensation Year 1: $204,250**

By my math, even with a 5% discount adjusting from Seattle to Chicago, this offer was higher than Google's and so I sent this new offer to my recruiter and crossed my fingers that she'd get back to me before my deadline (which was the following business day) and she did! 

<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;">
I heard back from the comp team and they were able to increase your Google offer even more to match your Confluent offer at 100% over 2 years :)  They let me know that for peer equity reasons, this is our max offer so since we won't be able to increase any more I will go ahead and request that an updated offer letter is sent your way. 
</blockquote>

Amazingly, it seemed that the Google compensation team treated the Confluent offer based out of Seattle as the same cost of living as Chicago, so they didn't actually discount it at all! The result was the maxed out Google Chicago offer:

Base: $111,000 \
Bonus: 15.00% \
Equity: $155,000 \
Sign-on: $25,000 \
Relocation Bonus: $8,400 

**Total Comp Year 1: $212,200**

This was a fantastic offer and I was super happy with the results of my negotiations with Google.

### Accepting an Offer

Naturally, I accepted the Google Chicago offer! Despite their initial lowball offer of 155k, getting them up to 212k with negotiations was obviously worth the effort of going through interviews with all the other companies!

### Learnings

Most companies will not negotiate if you don't have a competing offer. Google, for example, only increased its offer when another offer was higher. I've heard murmurs that Microsoft sometimes increases offer based soley on experience and added value.

In general, it's best not to ask for a specific number. This is advice that I've heard from other people and found to be pretty useful in my negotiations. When increasing my initial Google Chicago offer, I was initially aiming for at least 170k; had I told the recruiter that, I am confident I would be taking away a much lower offer today than I actually am. Going forward, when negotiating, I'll be continuing to avoid asking for specific figures and just use offers against one another to get the best value, only stating numbers when I've maxed out that route.

Hi [recruiter],

 
I wanted to let you know that, although [company] aligns really well with my career goals, I’ve done some self-evaluation and realized that from a personal goals perspective, [reason for declining] and so I will not be able to accept the offer.

I just wanted to say that this was an amazing recruiting experience and I very strongly appreciated how quickly the interview process progressed and that you, yourself, were a great recruiting point of contact. I really hope I get another chance down the line to work with you and with [company] when my goals better align; it’s been a pleasure!
