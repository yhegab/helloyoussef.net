## Getting an Internship at Google
*September 27, 2021*

This past Summer of 2021, I interned at Google. This blog post is a summary of the recruitment process that I went through.

### The First Try


The first time I ever heard back from Google was for the *Software Developer Intern, Winter 2019* role. The recruiter emailed me to let me know I'd soon be receiving a coding sample exercise and a snapshot survey. I was excited but mostly I was terrified -- I'd never done a *real* coding challenge before. There's no way I was good enough for Google, right? So I ignored the assessment and let the deadline pass and pushed it to the back of my mind. Instead, I decided to do a normal school term in Winter 2019 and try to get a more "achievable" internship in the summer -- which I did, so not a terrible loss altogether.

Looking back, I definitely agree with my past self; I was not capable, at the time, of passing the interviews and assessments that Google would throw at me. Skipping the assessment, however, was a huge mistake. Failure is an opportunity to identify your shortcomings, and avoiding failure, as I was doing, is a great way to stunt your growth. If I did fail the assessment, it would have been wise to figure out *why* I wasn't ready and evaluate what needed to be done in order to pass the next time around.

Learnings:

* Recognize my shortcomings, but take advantage of failures to grow
* You really do miss 100% of shots you don't take

### The Second Try

This time I applied, and with a referral! Around a year later, and I was feeling far more confident about my abilities as I received a referral to apply to the *Software Engineer Intern, Winter 2020* role.

On September 4, 2019, I received the same coding exercise and snapshot survey and actually went ahead and completed them. The coding sample was fine, I thought, but not particularly great either; I'd realized afterwards that I'd missed a few test cases and my solutions were actually far worse than I realized.

Understandably, I received an email on October 7, 2019, letting me know they would not be moving forward with my application. That Winter, I interned at **Yelp** instead, and had an amazing time in San Francisco.

Learnings:

* I really needed to find an efficient way to get better an algorithms and data structure problems
* Failing the coding exercise was an effective motivator

### Third time's the charm

tl;dr:
* August 11, 2020: Applied
* August 18, 2020: Heard back to schedule interviews
* August 25, 2020: Completed back-to-back phone interview
* August 31, 2020: Received an update that the recruiter received interview feedback and will be submitting to the hiring commitee.
* September 3, 2020: I let the recruiter know I had another offer with a deadline of October 7, 2020
* September 16, 2020: I emailed the recrutier to ask for an update; no dice.
* September 25, 2020: I missed a call from a Mountainview area code and emailed my recruiter to ask if that was her...it was not.
* September 29, 2020: I received an email from the recruiter to schedule a call!!
* September 30, 2020: The recruiter let me know I had passed the hiring committee stage with a guaranteed offer!
* October 1, 2020: I received the offer letter.
* October 30, 2021: I formally signed and accepted the offer!
* January 20, 2021: I receive an email from the recruiter to set up a host matching call with a team in Google Cloud!
* January 25, 2021: I have a quick 30 minute call where the host details the project, asks if I'm interested, and lets me asks questions.
* January 26, 2021: Project matched! Everything was ready for my internship to start in May.

#### Phone Interviews

<img src="phonescheduling.png" width="100%" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">

I had around a week to prepare for these interviews which, in all honestly, is not a lot of time at all. I focused on covering concepts from the [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions). I didn't do every question on that list, but I made sure to understand the approaches to all 10 of the general patterns listed there.

Looking back, one of the questions that I was asked was actually a Google-tagged question on Leetcode Premium, so if I had the time, it would have been worthwhile to brute force through all the Google-tagged leetcode questions. This strategy isn't exact the best for being able to cover new or unexpected questions, but if you have time, it's definitely helps to build a sense of comfort going into the interviews.

The coding environment for the itnerviews was pretty solid. I'd heard that in past years it was just on a Google Doc but mine was conducted on a proper online collaborative environment with syntax highlighting and indentation. Importantly, **there was no compilation**.

In the first phone interview, I was asked a relatively straightforward graphs question. When prodded on it a bit further, the interviewer asked if I could do it faster if I used more space, which led to a memoization-based solution. With some time to spare, I was then asked a pretty unique stack/array type question that I later found was Google-tagged as a leetcode medium.

In the second interview, the interviewer introduced me a well-known unix command line tool. He then asked me to write a function that replicated basic functionality of that tool. This question took me the entire 45 minutes and I felt so-so about this interview, but felt I had developed a great rapport with the interviewer.

#### The waiting game

Having finished the phone interviews on August 25, I was expecting to hear back from the hiring committee about the results around 2-3 weeks afterwards (as my recruiter had mentioned in her initial email). Around a week after the interviews, I received an update that the recruiter had received the interviewer feedback and would be sending it over to the hiring commitee.

After that, silence.

On September 16, around 3 weeks after my interviews, I emailed the recruiter for an update but was told there wasn't any update to be given. At the same time, I let my recruiter know of an offer deadline set for October 7.

Another two weeks pass with no update.

And then on September 29, I receive an update from the recruiter asking to schedule a call! And the following day, we hop on a call where she reveals that I've passed the hiring committee and that they've actually gone one step further and decided to give me a guaranteed team match, meaning they can give me an offer right away to sign!

#### Host matching

While it was nice to have a "guaranteed match", that still meant I had to fill out a project questionnaire with my work area preferences, previous coding experience, and a free-form where I discussed things about myself. This is what I wrote in my free-form response:

<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9;border-left: 10px solid #ccc;margin: 1.5em 10px;padding: 0.5em 10px;">
I have experiences in Cloud Computing, Infrastructure/Backend, and Data Science. Here are the details on internships/projects I’ve done for each field.

Cloud computing:

- I interned at Amazon Web Services in the Serverless org for the Step Functions team (the Google equivalent is probably Cloud Workflows, which is in beta)

- At AWS, I gained a strong exposure to cloud tooling as well as pipeline and infrastructure work.

- My main project was to reduce the deployment of new service integrations from 4-5 weeks down to under an hour by implementing a dynamic feature flag using AWS AppConfig (primarily with Java)

Infrastructure/Backend:

- I interned at Yelp within the Metrics Platform team to help make tooling and infrastructure for the data science and product teams. 

- At Yelp, my main project was an open source JupyterLab extension that allows users to monitor their spark jobs directly from the notebook cell from which they were spawned (https://github.com/itsjafer/jupyterlab-sparkmonitor). This project was especially useful as it allowed developers to see how much their Spark jobs cost at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic was forcing Yelp to cut costs.

Data Science:

- I interned at Vida Health (a start-up based in SF that provides mobile health solutions) within the Data Science team

- At Vida, I used primarily Python to improve the performance of a prediction pipeline through various optimizations

- Here, I also led and actively engaged in the design and creation of a recipe recommendation feature, developing a proof of concept in Python.


Finally, as someone that’s also completed internships in DevOps, Capital Markets, Mobile Development, and research, I like to consider myself the type of person that can hit the ground running in any product area! I have the drive to make anything my passion, and that’s what I believe has propelled me towards success in my internships — I’m always ready to learn!

At first, I structured the response in an essay format, but quickly realized that no host was taking the time to read a huge wall of hard-to-parse text. Around January 20th, I receive an email from my recruiter to schedule a host matching call with a team in Google Cloud!

The call was very straightforward: my (future) host described the project and made it clear that this was *not* a front-end project and would be primarily back-end work, which was exactly what I was looking for. He then asked me if I was interested and then the rest of the interview was just time for me to ask questions and get to know the project and his team a bit better -- overall, a very chill experience.

### Offer Signed!

After the host matching call, I found out the following day that there was a mutual interest and that everything was set for me to start my internship the upcoming May!

The actual internship itself was a fantastic experience, and I have plans to write a separate blog post about that as well :)
